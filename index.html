    <h2>CHANEL (Paris, 1910)</h2>

    <h3>Historical / Context Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Chanel is a Paris fashion house founded in 1910 whose fragrance work became one of the defining reference points of
      20th-century luxury advertising. In the context of campaign history, Chanel consistently treats fragrance as identity
      and myth—less “product story” and more cultural signal—built through controlled imagery, disciplined casting, and an
      insistence on permanence.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Parfum Campaigns, Chanel is included because its advertising language set enduring standards: minimal visual
      noise, high editorial authority, and a repeated ability to make a single bottle feel like an institution.
    </p>

    <h3>Campaign &amp; Visual Language</h3>
    <p>Chanel campaigns typically operate on three structural principles:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Icon-first framing:</strong> the bottle or emblem is treated like a seal, not a prop.</li>
      <li><strong>Editorial restraint:</strong> controlled color, clean negative space, and a refusal to “explain” the scent visually.</li>
      <li><strong>Casting as architecture:</strong> faces are selected for posture and myth, not relatability—reinforcing distance, authority, and longevity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Across decades, Chanel’s strongest work avoids trend-chasing. Even when campaigns become cinematic, the visual
      message remains: this is not a seasonal release; it is a permanent object.
    </p>

    <h3>Signature Eras / Campaign References</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No. 5 — The Icon Era (multi-decade):</strong> fragrance advertising as cultural mythology, positioned above fashion cycles.</li>
      <li><strong>1990s–2000s cinematic luxury:</strong> film-scale storytelling with the bottle treated as a formal artifact.</li>
      <li><strong>Modern men’s fragrance authority:</strong> clean architecture, monochrome discipline, command presence.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Bottle / Iconography Notes</h3>
    <p>
      Chanel’s bottle language is geometric, strict, and intentionally unromantic. Packaging is treated like typography:
      legibility over ornament, permanence over novelty.
    </p>

    <h3>Archival Notes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Images are archived as advertising artifacts, not lifestyle content.</li>
      <li>Credits are recorded only when verified.</li>
      <li>Representative executions are prioritized over exhaustive duplication.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Closing</h3>
    <p>
      Chanel is archived in Parfum Campaigns as a baseline house—proof that the strongest fragrance advertising does not
      chase attention. It consolidates authority until the bottle feels inevitable.
